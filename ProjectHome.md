If you want a free surveillance system, you probably want Zoneminder. If you have a lot of Android phones though, it's more scalable to do the motion detection on the phones instead of on a beefy centralized server. The fact that the phones have built-in UPS is nice too.

This project consists of two parts:

Android app
  * Triggers (motion detection built-in, external triggers through add-ons)
  * Filters (latitude built-in, external filters through add-ons)
  * Alerting
  * Record video and sync to server
AppEngine
  * Management and scheduling
  * Stream viewing
